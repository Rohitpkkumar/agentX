    """Spawn a focused sub-agent to handle a well-scoped sub-task.

    Use this to delegate a specific, self-contained piece of work to a fresh
    agent context. The sub-agent has access to all tools but starts with a
    clean conversation history, so it won't be confused by the parent context.

    Good uses:
    - "Read src/auth/middleware.py and write unit tests in tests/unit/test_auth.py"
    - "Refactor src/db/ to use connection pooling without changing the public API"
    - "Find all usages of old_function and replace with new_function"

    Args:
        description: Clear, self-contained description of the sub-task including
                     relevant file paths, expected outcome, and any constraints.

    Returns:
        The sub-agent's final response summarising what was accomplished.
